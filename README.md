# ThermoBondLib

Free library library that is designed as a graphical library for modeling convective flows using the thermo-bond graph metaphor (uses BondLib)

## Library description

The `ThermoBondLib` library relies heavily on the regular `BondLib` library. Most of the (red) bond graph elements are built internally from regular (black) bond graphs. Hence the user of ThermoBondLib needs to load BondLib also. For this reason, general remarks about graphical modeling using bond graphs don't need to be repeated here. Novice users of `ThermoBondLib` are advised to read the manual of the `BondLib` library.

### Dependencies

This library depends on:

* [BondLib](https://github.com/modelica-3rdparty/BondLib)

## Current release

Download [ThermoBondLib v2.1 (2008-01-05)](../../archive/v2.1.zip)

#### Release notes

* [Version v2.1 (2008-01-05)](../../archive/v2.1.zip)
  * ThermoBondLib 2.1 constitutes the first official release of ThermoBondLib, a library that has been around in one form or another since 2000. The original version of ThermoBondLib was based on Dymola 4.0. However, that version hadn't been documented yet and was strictly meant to be used by my students.
